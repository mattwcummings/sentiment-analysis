import csv

from textblob import TextBlob

filename = ("filename.csv") ### insert your file!

with open(filename, 'r') as csvfile:
    rows = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in rows:
        sentence = row[0]
        blob = TextBlob(sentence)
        print (blob.sentiment[1]) 
#remove [1] get full scores 
# i'd like be able to write sentiment analysis scores to csv file automatically
